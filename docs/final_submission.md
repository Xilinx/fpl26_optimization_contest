# Final Submission

## Key Details

* Final submission process/requirements are largely the same as for the [beta submission](beta_submission.html),
  but will be more strictly enforced
  * Please follow this process closely! Although contest organizers will use their best efforts to run all
    submissions, failures may lead to disqualification
* Final submissions will be evaluated on the contest [AWS instance configuration hardware](runtime.html)
  * Contest organizers will use their best efforts to run all submissions one or more (equal) number of times
    and accept their best result
* Submissions will be evaluated solely on a set of hidden benchmarks
* Final results will be made public at the [FPL 2026 conference](https://2026.fpl.org/)

## Runtime Environment

Please see the development and [runtime validation environment](runtime.html) page for details.

## Submission Process

TBA

### Closed-Source Submissions

While contestants are strongly encouraged to open-source their solutions at the
conclusion of the contest, there is no requirement to do so. In such cases,
it is still necessary to use the flow described above to produce a binary only
submission.
